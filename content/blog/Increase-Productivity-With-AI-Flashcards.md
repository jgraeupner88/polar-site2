Most of what you read you forget immediately again in fact, **our brain retains as little as 10%**. So that last hour you just spent reading that PDF? Forget about it.

So what’s the deal with retaining what you read? We’re not entirely sure, but one thing we are pretty sure about is:

**Practice makes perfect.**

That’s right, just like how it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill (thanks for that tidbit Malcolm Gladwell), it takes repetition after repetition to solidify a concept into long term memory.

And the way to do this is really simple: **Flashcards.**

Now, why don't we create more flashcards directly from our reading? **Often it's because it takes time...**

By the time you have highlighted the text, you'll want to keep on reading. And when you put that book down, you're likely not going to take an extra 20 min to create all those flashcards

That’s why we **partnered with OpenAI** to create **flashcards in one click using AI.**

With this feature, you can focus on what actually gives results - **read and remember what you just read.**

With one click, our algorithm will read the text you’ve highlighted and generate an question and answer pair. You just highlight what you want to remember, click the button, and the work is done for you.

Not only does it save time, you also get **questions worded differently.** This helps with reenetion and solidifying the concept in your brain.
