Estimates vary, but plenty of studies have shown that **you only retain 10% of what you read**. So you know that last hour you just spent reading that PDF? Forget about it.

Literally, you’ll forget about it.

There’s nothing wrong with your brain. In fact, **your brain can store over 2.5 petabytes of data**. To put it lightly, that’s nothing short of amazing.

So what’s the deal with retaining what you read? We’re not entirely sure, but one thing we are pretty sure about is:

**Practice makes perfect.**

That’s right, just like how it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill (thanks for that tidbit Malcolm Gladwell), it takes repetition after repetition to solidify a concept into long term memory.

And the way to do this is really simple: **Flashcards.**

Why don't we create more flashcards directly from our reading? **It takes time...**

By the time have highlighted the text, you'll want to keep on reading. And when you put that book down, you're likely not going to take an extra 20 min to create all those flashcards

That’s why we **partnered with OpenAI** to create **AI Flashcards in one click.**

With this feature, you can focus on what actually gives results - **read and remember what you just read.**

In two simple steps, our algorithm will read the text you’ve highlighted and generate a meaningful question in a flashcard format. You just highlight, click, and the work is done for you.

Check it out in action here:

With this approach, you also get the **benefit of differently worded questions.** This makes you see the question from different angles, improving your memory and solidifying the concept in your brain.
