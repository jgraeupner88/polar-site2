# Integrated Reader

Polar has an integrated reader for all uploaded documents. The reader supports EPUBs, PDFs, and webpages (captured through the Chrome extension). Any annotation, highlight, or comment created in Polar is captured into your annotation repository.

# Setting up your reader

You can personalize your reader across several areas - dark mode, PDF handling of dark mode, EPUB text width, automatic position resume, and auto-pagemarks. You can adjust all those items in your settings

Polar supports light and dark mode. Your global setting is automatically adopted for the reader. For PDFs, you can decide how dark mode is handled - from full color inversion, to grey scale, to keeping the original colors of the file.

In addition, Polar allows you to automatically resume your reading position if you turn the feature on. For this, you need to use pagemarks to mark your reading position. Pagemarks can be set manually by right-clicking anywhere in the file. Alternatively, you can also turn on auto-pagemarks which will automatically update your reading positio in the background.

# Managing the file in the reader

In the top right of the reader, you can manage your file the same way you can manage it in the document repository. This includes, tagging, flagging, archiving, opening and copying the original URL.

In addition, you can set the number of columns for a file there. Many research papers are written in a two-column format. If this is not setting is not defined for the document, it can mess up the order of annotations for example.

# Outline

The reader also provides an outline of the document, assuming the document includes one. By default, outline view is disabled. You can turn it on at the top left of the reader or by pressing ```[```.

# Annotation Sidebar

The annotation sidebar in the document reader shows a list of highlights, comments and
flashcards associated with a specific document.

This allows you to create, edit, tag, and delete annotations for a specific document
and view all annotations in one central location.

To view your annotations across all documents, use the annotation viewer in Polar.
